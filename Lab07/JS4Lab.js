 *                                     ~Lunch Date~
 *
 *  Your friend is coming over for lunch. Let's use code to decide what to eat!

/*---------------------------------- Let and Const -------------------------------------*/
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 1: Declaring Let and Const variables`)

/*
 * Step 1: Initialize two variables using 'const' and set the value of those variables to what you're having to eat and drink
 * Step 2: Initialize two more variables using 'let' and set one value to your name, and the other to your friends name.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
const food = 'Ramen'
let drink = 'Sake'
let myName = 'Isaac'
let myFriend = 'Juan'
//Question: Name a reason why you would use const instead of let.
//Answer: const will be used in case I don't want it to be flexible. Let lets you adjust the variable while const doesn't

/*---------------------------------- Template Literals -------------------------------------*/
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 2: Template Literals`)

/*
 * Step 1: Using template literals and the variables we just created,
 *         write a sentence describing what you and your friend are eating & drinking for lunch.
 *
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
console.log(`${myName} and ${myFriend} are out eating and drinking ${food} & ${drink}`)
//Question: How would the sentence you wrote look if you used string concatenation instead of template literals?
//          console.log() your answer to check
//Answer:
console.log(myName + ' and ' + myFriend + ' are out eating and drinking ' + food + ' & ' + drink)//alternative 1
console.log(myName.concat(' and ', myFriend, ' are out eating and drinking ', food, ' & ', drink));// alternative 2

console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 2a: Oh no`)

/* Oh no! You just remembered your friend is allergic to the drink we prepared!
 *
 * Step 1: In the section below, reassign your drink item to something else. console.log() your drink variable and run your code.
 * Step 2: Make a change to your code in Question 1 to fix the error. Run your code to make sure it's fixed.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
drink = 'Ice Tea'
console.log(drink);//Identifier 'drink' has already been declared. Since it's a const it cannot be altered
console.log(drink);//now that I changed const to let and reassigned the value of the variable it will log the new value

//Question: Read the error message - in your own words - what does it mean?
//Answer: it's simple a constant variable cannot be varied since it's constant. Let is preferred for things you 
//will need to redefine.

/*---------------------------------- Arrow Functions -------------------------------------*/
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 3: Arrow Functions`)

/* You and your friend eat together so often that having a new variable for each food/drink
 *     item could get tiring.
 *
 * Let's use functions so we can easily describe what we're eating.
 *
 * Step 1: Using ES6 standards, write a fat arrow function using const called "lunchTime" that
 *         takes in two parameters: foodChoice, and drinkChoice.
 * Step 2: Have the function 'return' the same sentenced you used to describe eating lunch above
 *         but replace the food/drink variables with our newly created parameters.
 * Step 3: Copy the code below, ↓ paste it underneath our new function, and run the code.
 *         console.log(lunchTime('Pizza','Water'))
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
const lunchTime = (foodChoice, drinkChoice) => {
   return `${myName} and ${myFriend} are out eating and drinking ${foodChoice} & ${drinkChoice}`
}
console.log(lunchTime('Pizza','Water'));
console.log(lunchTime('Sushi','Champagne'));
//Question: What would your function look like if we were using the old way of creating a function?
//Answer:
/* function lunchTime(foodChoice, drinkChoice) {
   return (myName + 'and' myFriend " are out eating and drinking" + foodChoice + drinkChoice);
}
console.log(lunchTime('Pizza', 'Water'));

/*---------------------------------- Callbacks -------------------------------------*/
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 4: Callbacks`)

/**
 * You and your friend ALWAYS eat lunch, but it might be a good idea to plan for the next date in advance.
 * Let's use functions and callbacks to describe what we're eating today, and what we want tomorrow.
 *
 * Step 1: Create a ES6 fat arrow function called 'foodForTodayAndTomorrow' that takes 3 parameters: tomorrowsFoodChoice, tomorrowsDrinkChoice, and callbackFunction.
 * Step 2: Have your function return a new string in this format: `${callbackFunction} Tomorrow we want ${tomorrowsFoodChoice} and ${tomorrowsDrinkChoice}.`
 * Step 3: console.log() your new function, foodForTodayAndTomorrow, and pass in lunchTime('newFoodItem', 'newDrinkItem') as the argument for the "callbackFunction" parameter.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
let foodForTodayAndTomorrow = (tomorrowsFoodChoice, tomorrowsDrinkChoice, callbackFunction) => {
   return `${callbackFunction()}. Tomorrow we want ${tomorrowsFoodChoice} and ${tomorrowsDrinkChoice}.`;
}

// Define a function that returns today's food and drink
let lunchTime = (todaysFood, todaysDrink) => {
   return `Today we are having ${todaysFood} and ${todaysDrink}`;
}

// Pass a function reference using an arrow function
console.log(foodForTodayAndTomorrow('Sushi', 'Green Tea', () => lunchTime('Pizza', 'Water')));

console.log(`-----------Finished------------`)
